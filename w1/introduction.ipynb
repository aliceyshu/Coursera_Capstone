You will learn how to make RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world. You will also learn how to be creative in situations where data are not readily available by scraping web data and parsing HTML code. You will utilize Python and its pandas library to manipulate data, which will help you refine your skills for exploring and analyzing data. \r\n","\r\n","Finally, you will be required to use the Folium library to great maps of geospatial data and to communicate your results and findings."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"button":false,"new_sheet":false,"run_control":{"read_only":false}},"source":["<hr>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"button":false,"new_sheet":false,"run_control":{"read_only":false}},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\r\n","import numpy as np "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["print('Hello Capstone Project Course!')"]}],"metadata":{"anaconda-cloud":{},"interpreter":{"hash":"5dd85eeeed23a60a0ed349cc05fa75301d4c6e1110df34e4e124be843ef5bb8d"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3.7.6 64-bit ('base': conda)","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":""},"widgets":{"state":{},"version":"1.1.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
